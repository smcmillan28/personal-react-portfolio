## Takeaways and Future Development
As I complete more projects, I plan to add them to my portfolio.  This is now my second React project and the first using Router to include more than one page.  The data is on this page is mostly static, and the projects included are primarily front-end, so future development will be involving more full stack projects on my portfolio page which will require continuously adding skills to my repertoire.
